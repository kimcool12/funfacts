		<h3># #Facts About Animals</h3>
		<p>
			Animals are multicellular organisms that belong to the kingdom Animalia. They are found all over the world in a wide range of environments, from the depths of the ocean to the highest mountains. Animals are incredibly diverse, with millions of different species ranging from microscopic organisms to giant whales. They are integral to the ecological balance of the planet and have a significant impact on the environment around them. The classification of animals is based on a range of characteristics, including their body structure, habitat, and feeding habits. Many animals are kept as pets or used for food, and some are used for transportation or farming. Despite their differences, all animals share some common traits, such as the ability to move, reproduce, and interact with their environment.
			Here are some facts about Animals
			<ol>
				<li> Elephants can communicate with each other through a range of vocalizations and infrasound.</li>
                <li> The blue whale is the largest animal on Earth, with a heart that can weigh as much as a car.</li>
                <li> Cows have an excellent sense of smell and can detect scents up to six miles away.</li>
                <li> Polar bears are the world's largest land predator and have black skin despite their white fur.</li>
                <li> The fastest land animal is the cheetah, which can run up to speeds of 70 miles per hour.</li>
                <li> Some species of birds can see ultraviolet light, allowing them to identify unique patterns in flowers, fruits, and prey.</li>
                <li> Many male seahorses are the ones who give birth to their young.</li>
                <li> The immortal jellyfish can revert back to its juvenile state when it is damaged, making it biologically immortal.</li>
                <li> Armadillos are the only mammal species that can roll into a complete ball for defense.</li>
                <li> Some species of octopus are known to be able to escape through tiny openings or crevices that are small enough to be blocked by their beak.</li>

		<h4>#Facts About Plants</h4>
		<p>Plants are organisms that belong to the kingdom Plantae and can be found on almost every continent on Earth. They come in various shapes and sizes, from towering trees to delicate flowers, and provide oxygen, food, and shelter for a wide range of organisms. Plants are incredibly important for the planet's health, as they help stabilize the Earth's climate by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen through photosynthesis. Many plants are also used in medicine, clothing, and everyday household products. The classification of plants is based on various characteristics, such as their vascular system, reproductive structures, and the type of habitat they inhabit. Despite their differences, all plants share the ability to absorb sunlight and produce their food through photosynthesis, which is a vital process for sustaining life on Earth.</p>
	    <p>Plants are classified primarily based on their physical and biological characteristics such as their structure, growth habit, reproductive system, and other key features. Here is a brief overview of the common classification categories of plants:
	  <ul> 	

          <li> Kingdom - All plants are classified under the Kingdom Plantae.</li>
          <li> Division - Plants are further divided into different divisions including Bryophyte (mosses and liverworts), Pteridophyte (ferns and allies), Coniferophyta (conifers), and Magnoliophyta (flowering plants).</li>
          <li> Class - The plants belonging to Magnoliophyta are further classified into two classes: Dicotyledonae (dicots) and Monocotyledonae (monocots).</li>
          <li> Order - Each class is divided into orders, for example, in the dicots there are orders such as Brassicales (mustard and cabbage families) and Fabales (pea and bean families).</li>
          <li> Family - An order contains one or more families, for example, the Rosaceae family (roses and apples) belong to the order Rosales.</li>
          <li> Genus - A family is further divided into multiple genera, such as Malus (apples) and Rosa (roses) belonging to the family Rosaceae.</li> 
          <li> Species - Each genus includes one or more species, for example, 'sativa' is a species of rice, while 'indica' is another species of rice.</li>

The classification of plants helps to categorize them based on their key features, which is useful for understanding their biological and ecological properties.
     Here are facts about plants
<ol>
     <li> They can be found on almost every continent on Earth, and in a variety of different habitats.</li>
     <li> All plants have a cell wall, chloroplasts, and the ability to carry out photosynthesis.</li>
     <li> Some plants, such as cacti, have adapted to dry environments by developing specialized water-storing tissues.</li>
     <li> The tallest plants on Earth are redwood trees, which can grow up to 380 feet tall.</li>
     <li> The oldest known living plant is a bristlecone pine tree in California, which is over 5,000 years old.</li>
     <li> Some plants, such as Venus flytraps, can capture and digest insects for nutrients.</li>
     <li> The world's largest flower, Rafflesia arnoldii, can grow up to three feet in diameter and weigh up to 15 pounds.</li>
     <li> Plants are an important source of food for humans and animals, providing key nutrients and energy.</li>
     <li> Many common medicines, such as aspirin, are derived from plants or their extracts.</li>
     <li> Some plants have evolved to reproduce asexually by producing "clones" of themselves.</li>
     <li> Plants use a variety of strategies to protect themselves from predators, such as thorns or poisonous chemicals.</li>
     <li> The rubber used to make car tires and other products comes from rubber trees, which are native to South America.</li>
     <li> Plants can communicate with each other through chemical signals, helping to defend against predators and coordinate pollination.</li>
     <li> In addition to their ecological and economic importance, plants also have significant cultural and aesthetic value, inspiring artists and poets throughout history.</li>
